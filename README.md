AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Description

This is a team project that is part of the ALX Software Engineering Program curriculum.
It is the first step towards building the full web application: AirBnB Clone.

In this first step we:
- Create our data models
- Build a custom command-line interface(console) for data management
- Manage(create, update, destroy, etc) objects via the console
- Store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

## Usage

The console works both in interactive mode and non-interactive mode, much like a Unix shell.

### Interactive mode example

The shell should work like this in interactive mode:

```bash
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
```

### Non-interactive mode example

The shell should work like this in non-interactive mode:

```bash
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
```

### Commands

Command | Description
------- | -----------
help `[command]` | Displays all available commands and provides documentation
quit | Exits the program
EOF  | Exits the program
create `class_name`       | Creates a new instance of the class `class_name`
show `class_name` `id`    | Prints the string representation of an instance based on the `class_name` and `id`
destroy `class_name` `id` | Deletes an instance based on the `class_name` and `id`
all `[class_name]`        | Prints the string representation of all instances based or not on the `class_name`
update `class_name` `id` `attribute_name` `"attribute_value"` | Updates an instance based on the `class_name` and `id` by adding or updating `attribute_name`

## Models

The folder [models](./models/) contains all the data models used in this project defined as classes.

File | Description
---- | -----------
[base_model.py](./models/base_model.py) | BaseModel class for all the other classes
[user.py](./models/user.py) | User class for user data
[amenity.py](./models/amenity.py) | Amenity class for amenity data
[city.py](./models/city.py) | City class for city location data
[state.py](./models/state.py) | State class for state location data
[place.py](./models/place.py) | Place class for accommodation data
[review.py](./models/review.py) | Review class for user/host review data

## File storage

The folder [engine](./models/engine/) manages the serialization and deserialization of all the data, following a JSON format.

A FileStorage class is defined in [file_storage.py](./models/engine/file_storage.py) with methods to follow this flow:
```<object> -> to_dict() -> <dictionary> -> JSON dump -> <json string> -> FILE -> <json string> -> JSON load -> <dictionary> -> <object>```

The [__init__.py](./models/__init__.py) file contains the instantiation of the FileStorage class called **storage**, followed by a call to the method reload() on that instance.
This allows the storage to be reloaded automatically at initialization, which recovers the serialized data.

## Tests

All the code is tested using python's **unittest** module.
The tests are in the [tests](./tests/) folder.
